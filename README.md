# This repository is to show off an example of how a ConditionalWeakTable works, as well as how you can use it to add new sprites to your slugcat.
Check out the [CWT](https://github.com/iwantbrioche/CWTExample/blob/master/src/CWT.cs) and [Hooks](https://github.com/iwantbrioche/CWTExample/blob/master/src/Hooks/Hooks.cs) classes for information on how a CWT works!
